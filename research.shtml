    <h3>Research</h3>

    <p>
          My research interests lie in human-computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), and computer science education (CS Education). </p>
          <p>I am interested in bridging the gap between current technologies and humans. 
          It is way too common that current technologies miss the 'human' element, even though we emphasize user-friendliness. For example, generative AI tools such as DALL-E3, Stable Diffusion, and DeepFloyed IF transform textual prompts into images. 
          These tools seem straightforward to use, but the challenge lies in creating the perfect prompt to generate the desired images, a process commonly referred to as prompt engineering. 
          Users often turn to AI like ChatGPT to help craft these prompts. 
          ChatGPT assists users by structuring descriptions and choosing appropriate modifiers based on user input. 
          However, these tools often lack the domain-specific knowledge needed for tasks like fashion design, requiring users to provide extremely detailed and precise descriptions, which assumes a high level of expertise in the domain, something not all users possess. 
          One of my research projects aims to enable users to produce high-quality outputs without spending extensive time on prompt engineering or repeatedly clicking the generate button. 
          Our work has been summarized in a paper listed below, i.e., <a target="_blank" href="Imagine_a_Dress.pdf">"Imagine a dress": Exploring the case of task-specific prompt assistants for text-to-image AI tools</a>. </p>
          <p>Additionally, I have a passion for teaching. 
          I have worked as an Instructional Support Assistant across six terms, supporting over 2000 students in four different computer science courses. 
          For more details on the courses I have assisted with and student evaluations, please refer to the 'Teaching' tab. 
          My interests in CS education research include integrating elements into the curriculum that enhance students' consideration of humanity. </p>
          <p>As a senior undergraduate student and junior researcher, I greatly appreciate the guidance from my supervisors. 
          I am still in the process of exploring my research topics and am open to collaborating on projects related to HCI, AI, and CS education. 
          Please feel free to email me if you are interested in discussing potential collaborations.

      "Imagine a Dress": Exploring the case of task-specific prompt assistants for text-to-image AI tools
    </h5>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <b>Abstract</b>: In this paper we explore the impact of task-specific prompt assistants for text-to-image generative AI tools through a user study. Participants were asked to recreate a dress with SDXL using either a prompt assistant tailored to dress design, or, no assistant at all. A detailed analysis of the results and feedback suggests that for this specific task, a tailored assistant improves result satisfaction and accuracy. This style of assistant helps users focus on the task by providing a detailed, visual and organized approach to describing the object---enabling faster production times and more accurate descriptions with less ambiguity. <a target="_blank" href="Imagine_a_Dress.pdf">Preprint</a>
